# Exercise: Polaris Form

Goal: create a form to update the given user, you must use (Polaris)[https://polaris.shopify.com/] components to build it.

User object in JSON (represents a user given by the api):

{
  "first_name": "Lunaris",
  "last_name": "S.",
  "address": "Tokyo, Kichijoji Honcho 1",
  "birthday": "2008-02-20",
  "gender": "unknown"
